# Noted

This project is a simplified clone of the popular productivity application, Notion. It's designed to replicate some of the core features of Notion, providing a platform where users can create, edit, and organize their notes in a flexible and intuitive interface.

It uses Convex as the backend, which is a real-time database that allows for instant data updates. The application also uses Edgestore, a distributed key-value store, to manage the images and files uploaded by the users.The user authentication is handled by Clerk, a secure and scalable user authentication API.

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd noted-main
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set up environment variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```env
# Convex (will be auto-generated by 'npx convex dev')
CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT=
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=

# Clerk Authentication
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=

# EdgeStore File Storage
EDGE_STORE_ACCESS_KEY=
EDGE_STORE_SECRET_KEY=
```

### 4. Get API keys

#### Convex (Backend Database)

1. Go to [https://convex.dev](https://convex.dev) and sign up/login
2. Create a new project
3. Run `npx convex dev` in your project directory - this will automatically:
   - Log you into Convex
   - Create/connect to your deployment
   - Add `CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL` to your `.env.local` file

#### Clerk (Authentication)

1. Go to [https://clerk.com](https://clerk.com) and sign up/login
2. Create a new application
3. In the Clerk Dashboard, go to **API Keys**
4. Copy the following keys to your `.env.local`:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` (starts with `pk_test_...`)
   - `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` (starts with `sk_test_...`)

5. **Configure JWT Template for Convex** (IMPORTANT):
   - In Clerk Dashboard, go to **JWT Templates**
   - Click **New template**
   - **Name**: `convex` (MUST be exactly "convex" in lowercase - this is critical!)
   - **Token Lifetime**: 60 minutes (or default)
   - **Signing Algorithm**: RS256
   - **Custom Signing Key**: OFF (disabled)
   - **Claims**: `{}` (empty object - Clerk adds default claims automatically)
   - Click **Save**

   > ⚠️ **Important**: The template name MUST be exactly `convex` (lowercase). If you name it "Convex" or anything else, authentication will fail with a 404 error.

#### EdgeStore (File Storage)

1. Go to [https://edgestore.dev](https://edgestore.dev) and sign up/login
2. Create a new store
3. In the store dashboard, go to **Settings** or **API Keys**
4. Copy the following keys to your `.env.local`:
   - `EDGE_STORE_ACCESS_KEY`
   - `EDGE_STORE_SECRET_KEY`

### 5. Configure Convex Authentication

The `convex/auth.config.js` file should already be configured with your Clerk domain. Verify it matches your Clerk Frontend API URL:

```javascript
export default {
  providers: [
    {
      domain: "https://your-clerk-domain.clerk.accounts.dev",
      applicationID: "convex",
    },
  ],
};
```

Replace `your-clerk-domain` with your actual Clerk domain (found in your Clerk Dashboard → API Keys → Frontend API URL).

### 6. Run the application

**Terminal 1 - Start Convex:**
```bash
npx convex dev
```

Wait until you see "Convex functions ready!" before proceeding.

**Terminal 2 - Start Next.js:**
```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Troubleshooting

- **404 Error when logging in**: Make sure your Clerk JWT template is named exactly `convex` (lowercase)
- **Convex not connecting**: Ensure `npx convex dev` is running and shows "Convex functions ready!"
- **Environment variables not loading**: Restart your Next.js dev server after adding/changing `.env.local`
- **Clerk authentication errors**: Verify your Clerk domain in `convex/auth.config.js` matches your Clerk Dashboard Frontend API URL
